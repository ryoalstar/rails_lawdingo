        %h1 Lawyer FAQs
        %br
        %h3 How does it work?
        %p You're eligible to apply for a lawyer account if you are a member in good standing of one or more American state bar associations. Once you've created an account, complete your profile by recording an intro video, listing the services you offer, and setting your hours of availability. During your hours of availability, clients will be able to reach you by phone to start a consultation with you. To be available by video chat, which is most clients' preferred mode of communication, you just need to be logged in to lawdingo.com and keep your browser open. 
        %p Clients will be able to talk to you free of charge for the duration you've set for free consultations, and thereafter they will be billed at the hourly rate you've set, prorated to the minute. 
        %br
        %h3 Is an attorney-client relationship formed?
        %p Lawdingo is not involved in this determination. You should treat inbound contacts as if they were people calling you by phone. Conflicts checks, engagement letters, identity verification, and so on are left to your discretion. Lawdingo doesn't (and legally, can't) get involved in that.
        %br
        %h3 Is fee-splitting involved?
        %p No. Lawdingo does not take any cut of charges you earn. While we're getting started, we're not even charging a subscription fee, but you can expect that there will be a monthly subscription that is independent of clients delivered or fees generated by those clients.
